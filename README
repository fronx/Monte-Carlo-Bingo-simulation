Matlab solution to http://programmingpraxis.com/2009/02/19/bingo/ by moink

Simulates games of Bingo.  Number of cards, number of runs, size of cards, 
ratio of numbers on cards to available numbers, whether or not there is a 
free space in the centre, are available as parameters to bingoprob.m

This seems inefficient.  I'm thinking I should change the collection of cards
from a cell array a three-dimensional matrix.  Other than that I can't think 
of any improvements.

To run, run the script bingoscript.m

Output should look like

averagefor1card =

   41.0610

Elapsed time is 2.788495 seconds.

averagefor500cards =

   12.1090

Elapsed time is 219.205069 seconds.

Of course, since it's stochastic, answer will vary slightly every time
Also, elapsed time will depend on the speed of your computer and will also
vary from run to run.
